Author: John Bickar

The Stanford Events Export module contains Views that expose Stanford Event
content as JSON and XML data. Useful in combination with the Stanford Drupal
Events Importer module to migrate Stanford Event content from one Drupal site
to another.

Note: The master branch is empty. Please check out the appropriate branch
(e.g., 7.x-1.x-dev) for your version of Drupal core.
